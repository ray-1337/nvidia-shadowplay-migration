# NVIDIA ShadowPlay Migration Cross Devices
This is a personal GitHub repository project moving my recording files from NVIDIA ShadowPlay source destination to another destination.

## Motivation
I wanted to organize my recording files to another hard drive. That's it.

## Installation
Install packages by doing `pnpm install`, set up the `config.mjs` and start the file by doing `node .` on console or simply double left-click the `start.bat` file.
